The repository is my learning and assignment from the course EECS 498.008/598.008 - Deep Learning for Computer Vision - UMich.
The topics learnt from the course: <br />
i) Linear classifiers <br />
ii) Stochastic gradient descent <br />
iii) Fully-connected networks <br />
iv) Convolutional networks <br />
v) Recurrent networks <br />
vi) Attention and transformers <br />
vii) Object detection <br />
viii) Image segmentation <br />
ix) Video Classification <br />
x) Generative models (GANs, VAEs, autoregressive models) <br />

<br />
<br />

The assignments are completed in Python and PyTorch on Google Colab. <br />
